enrich.py steps:
    1. Load the datasets
    2. Inspect columns to determine the key for merging. (zipcode was the key for these datasets)
    3. Make sure the format for key values are the same. (converted 9-digit zipcode to 3 digits)
    4. Clean the data
    5. Reduce the size of the datasets by removing unecessary columns and taking samples from the datasets
    6. Merge the datasets
    7. Save the new dataset as a new csv file
